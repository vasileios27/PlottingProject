# PlottingProject

The Plotting script aims to give an example of plotting code based on the python packages of Pandas and matplotlib. 

If you are asking why to use pandas, the answer is simple. Pandas dataframes are made to handle large amount of data and in comparison with matplotlib they create a nit way of plotting large datasets.
